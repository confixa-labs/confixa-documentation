# Troubleshooting

- **Failed Deployment** — Check your Git repository credentials, configuration, or Helm charts.
- **Approval or Signup Issues** — Confirm that new users are approved by Administrator under IAM after onboarding.
- **Login or Password Problem** — Use the “Reset Password” option or reach out to Support if needed.
- **Anomalous Metrics or Logs** — View traces, enable debug logging, or search for related messages in ELK to aid incidents.
- **Connectivity or Integrations** — Confirm proper configuration for Git, Docker Registry, Cloud, or other integrated services.
- **Health Check Failures** — Monitor deployed application's readiness, restart if needed, or debug through Confixa's Dashboard.
