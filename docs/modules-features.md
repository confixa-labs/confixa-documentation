# Modules / Features

## Dashboard
---
Provides a **central view** of your Confixa platform —

with key metrics, health statuses, and activity overviews —

so you're always up to date with your ecosystem.

## Projects
---
Organize your workloads and services into **logical groups or projects**.

Each project maintains its own **environments and configurations**, making team collaboration, lifecycle management, and delivery much more efficient.

Projects enable you to **isolate responsibilities, track progress, and manage resources** in a way that aligns with your team's structure and goals.

## Applications
---
Create, deploy, and manage your **applications** directly from Confixa.

Every application ties back to a project and is deployed to your **Kubernetes clusters** following your CI/CD pipeline.

## Issues
---
Create issues directly from Confixa **with the help of AI** by specifying a **title and description**.

These issues enable you to **modify or update the content of the Helm chart in your organization's repository or add new files related to the deployment of microservices** — all while retaining complete oversight and collaboration within your team.

## Chatbot
---
Provides **AI-assisted support and guidance** for your team — retrieving relevant data from **ELK** based on your prompts.

The chatbot's response includes **information, details, root cause, and potential solutions** for the issues you're investigating, helping you resolve problems faster and more efficiently.

## Support
---
Access technical assistance and support for your Confixa platform — whether you need **troubleshooting, guidance, or customizations**.

Support requests can be raised directly from Confixa for faster resolution through **ticket-based support**, or by sending an email to **confixa7@gmail.com**.
