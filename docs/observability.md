Identify performance bottlenecks and track usage trends over time, enabling you to make data-informed decisions.

## Logs (ELK)
---
Search, filter, and correlate application and container logs to aid in faster incident resolution and root-cause analysis.

Centralize all your logs in a single platform for easy investigation.

## Traces (ELK)
---
Analyze service traces to identify bottlenecks, latency contributors, or dependency issues within your architecture.

Understand **transaction flows and service interactions** to aid in optimizing performance and resiliency.
